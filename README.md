## Introduction

As LLMs become central to agents, chatbots, knowledge systems, and content generation, the security surface expands. This document reworks the original *Seezo LLM Security 101* with improved structure, updated threat taxonomy, modern tools, and deeper best practices.

Key original themes preserved:

- The “human attack surface” — users can be manipulated via prompt engineering.  
- Catalogs of offensive and defensive tools.  
- Example vulnerabilities & prompts.  
- Encouragement of community contributions.

## What is an LLM?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep models trained on massive text corpora. They can generate or complete language, answer queries, translate, summarize, code, and more. They are powerful but non-deterministic and vulnerable to misuse, leakage, and bias.

Common applications:

- Chat / conversational interfaces  
- Summarization / rewriting / translation  
- Code generation / assistance  
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
- Agentic / multi-step systems  

Because they generalize across data, they pose risks of unintended information exposure and manipulation.

## OWASP GenAI / Top 10 for LLM Apps

The original Seezo repo referenced an OWASP Top 10 list. That project has now evolved under **OWASP GenAI Security**.  
See OWASP’s official project page for GenAI security: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
More context on the evolution: https://genai.owasp.org/2025/03/26/project-owasp-promotes-genai-security-project-to-flagship-status/ :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

Below is a refined Top 10 adapted from both Seezo’s framework and OWASP GenAI:

1. Prompt Injection  
2. Data Leakage / Sensitive Disclosure  
3. Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion  
4. Model Theft, Poisoning, or Supply-Chain Risk  
5. Unsafe Output Handling / Composition  
6. Hallucination / Overreliance  
7. Bias & Ethical Harm  
8. Insufficient Monitoring & Logging  
9. Access Control & Privilege Misuse  
10. Third-Party / Plugin Integration Risk

## LLM Vulnerability Categories

### Security / Integrity Risks

- **Data Leakage / Sensitive Output**  
  E.g. the model reveals internal system prompts, context data, or private records.  
- **Prompt Injection & Adversarial Input**  
  Malicious inputs that override rules or control chain-of-thought.  
- **Unsafe Output / Execution**  
  Generated content leading to code execution, SQL injection, or unsafe commands.  
- **Code Generation / Malicious Scripts**  
  E.g. “Generate a script to exfiltrate data.”  
- **Impersonation / Social Engineering via LLM**  
  LLM pretends to be a trusted entity for malicious ends.  
- **Hallucination / False Assertions**  
  Invented facts that mislead downstream systems.  
- **Jailbreak / Escape**  
  Prompts crafted to disable safety filters or constraints.

### Bias, Fairness & Ethical Risks

- **Stereotype Reinforcement / Demographic Bias**  
- **Underrepresented Group Neglect**  
- **Political / Ideological Bias**  
- **Misinformation / Disinformation**  
- **Privacy Violations & PII Leakage**  
- **Copyright / Plagiarism Risks**

## Offensive Tools & Techniques

Here’s a revised list combining original and extended tools (verify these URLs yourself):

- **Gandalf** — prompt injection testing / challenge  
- **Rebuff** — prompt injection harness  
- **LLM Hacker Toolkit** — fuzzing, probing, leakage scripts  
- **Chain-of-answer Attacks** — sequential extraction prompts  
- **Role-play Persona Attacks** — trick the LLM via simulated roles  

_(You should validate and link to each tool’s official repo or site.)_

## Defensive Tools & Strategies

Adopting a layered defense approach:

- Prompt sanitization / validation  
- Output filtering & schema enforcement  
- Prompt injection detection / classification  
- Adversarial fine-tuning / robust training  
- Monitoring, logging, anomaly detection  
- Quotas / rate limiting  
- Isolation & sandbox execution  
- Plugin / extension vetting  
- Privacy techniques (differential privacy, masking)  

---

## Real-World Incidents & Lessons

From original repository and extended:

- **Microsoft Tay (2016):** turned toxic within hours  
- **Samsung Internal Code Leak (2023):** proprietary content exposed via LLM  
- **Amazon hiring bias experiment**  
- **“Sydney” / Bing AI misbehaviors**  
- **ChatGPT jailbreaks (2023–24)**  

Each case reveals failed controls, insufficient monitoring, or misaligned assumptions.

## Security Recommendations & Best Practices

- Adopt defense-in-depth (input + output checks)  
- Least privilege design (access, roles, separation)  
- Continuous red-teaming & adversarial testing  
- Logging, observability, alerting  
- Bias audits, dataset transparency  
- Use external validators / fact checkers  
- Vet integrations, sandbox plugin execution  
- Acknowledge model limitations, document uncertainty  
- Align with standards: OWASP GenAI, NIST AI RMF, ISO 23894
